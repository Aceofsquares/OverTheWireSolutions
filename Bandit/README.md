# Bandit

This directory is for collecting the solutions to the bandit challenges on Over The Wire.  Each solution is recorded by me.  These are not the first time I have gone through the Bandit challenge, however, the last time I did these challenges were a few years ago so they are a recording of what I've learned since then.

I will have a write up coming out for each one as well.

I recommend trying the challenges yourself without any help and only when you've ran out of ideas and feel like you lost track, should you look at a solution.  When you look at a solution, keep in mind it might not be the only solution.

Also, learn a scripting language.  Python is a good one to start with.
